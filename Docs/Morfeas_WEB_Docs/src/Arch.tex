The Morfeas WEB is architect as a classic server-client system that using HTTP messages for communication. Specifically the Morfeas WEB initialize ``GET" and ``POST" HTTP requests
for the transfer of the pages and data. The transmission of the WEB pages to client handled by the Apache server and the data by the Morfeas WEB PHP scripts. 
The contents of every HTTP requests that evolving on the Morfeas WEB is compressed. The ``GET" request compressed by the GNU ZIP algorithm and ``POST" by the internally implemented compress algorithm.
