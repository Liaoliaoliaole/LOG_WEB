\section{Morfeas System configuration} \label{sys_conf}
The ``Morfeas System configuration" utility can be accessed from the Morfeas WEB front page from the button with the Morfeas core configuration logo
(\includegraphics[height=.150in]{../art/morfeas_gear.png}).\\

The ``Morfeas System configuration" utility have three tabs, that are: ``Morfeas System", ``ISOStandards", ``Up/Down Load".
With the ``Morfeas System" tab the user can manipulate the components of the Morfeas system.
The ``ISOStandards" tab, print in a table the current ISOStandards file that is loaded in the server.
The ``Up/Down Load" tab have the necessary utilities for download the current ISOStandard and upload a new one.
Also to get/set the Morfeas configuration and ISOChannels using the Morfeas bundle files (mbl).\\

\noindent At the following subsections will be introduced the operation for each tab of the utility.

\subsection{``Morfeas System"}
At the figure \ref{fig:Morfeas_sys_conf} shown an example of the ``Morfeas System" tab.
The left side have a tree with the currently configured components of the Morfeas system.
The Morfeas System can have up to 16 components, from them one is always occupied by the Morfeas OPC-UA component,
so 15 of them are used configurable.

	\label{fig:Morfeas_sys_conf}
\end{figure}

Bellow the components tree are three buttons with command that are for manipulation of the components.
That are: ``Add", ``Remove", ``Save".\\

\noindent The ``Add" button can add a new components, when it is press will show a new window with the ``Add Component" utility
(figure \ref{fig:Morfeas_sys_conf_add_comp}).
The ``Add Component" utility required from the user to choose what type of component will be added, together with the necessary options.\\

\noindent The ``Remove" button will remove from the tree the component which is selected (except from the Morfeas OPC-UA. Which can not be removed).\\

\noindent The ``Save" button will send and apply the modification to the server.\\

The right section of the ``Morfeas System" tab, contains the configuration options of the selected component.
For any change there to be applied need to be saved before with the ``Save" button.

\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{``ISOStandards"}
The ``ISOStandards" tab show an instance of the current ISOStandard file as table.
The table have five columns with titles: ``NAME", ``DESCRIPTION", ``UNIT", ``MAX", ``MIN".
Every row of the table contains the field data of each ISO Standard, sourced from the ISOStandards file.
The ISOStandards file is a XML file structured as shown at listing \ref{lst:ISOStandard}.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,caption=Structure of ISOstandard file,label=lst:ISOStandard]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
  <points>
    <ISOStandard_name_tag> <!-- Up to 20 Characters -->
      <description>Description of ISOStandard</description>
      <unit>Default Unit</unit>
      <max>Maximum value</max>
      <min>Minumum value</min>
    </ISOStandard_name_tag>
    ....
  </points>
</root>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{``Up/DownLoad"}
The ``Up/DownLoad" (figure \ref{fig:sys_conf_up_down}) is the last tab of the ``Morfeas System configuration" utility.
It have purpose to the allow the user to upload and download the ISOStandards file and the Morfeas system configuration in mbl file form.\\

\noindent
The ISOStandards file that will be uploaded must have be structured as shown at listing \ref{lst:ISOStandard}.
The file selected by the ``Browse" button at the ISOStandard Up/DownLoad section.
After of a successful selection the file will be validated against the standard,
and after of a successful validation will be ready to be Upload to the server.
For download of the current ISOChannels file from the server the Download button of the ISOStandard Up/DownLoad section can be used.\\

\noindent
The ``Morfeas Bundle Up/Download" section of the ``Up/DownLoad" tab used to get and/or set the configuration of the Morfeas system.
This done by the mbl (Morfeas BundLe) files, which are a custom made format file that contain the Morfeas system's components and them configuration
together with the lastly configured ISOChannels, in a single archived file.\\
A mbl file can be selected by the ``Browse" button at the ``Morfeas Bundle Up/Download" section, and be Uploaded to the server by the ``Upload" button.\\
The ``Download" button of the ``Morfeas Bundle Up/Download" section download to the local system a new mbl file (Named as Hostname\_Date-of-creation).
