\section{Morfeas WEB NOx-if/Portal UI}
The Morfeas WEB NOx-if/Portal can be accessed from the "Morfeas WEB" front page by clicking in the dedicated button (NOXs Portal).
A new window will open with the Morfeas WEB NOx-if Portal.
Then select from top-left corner the CAN-if name and the UniNOx address on interest.
At figure \ref{fig:NOX-if_UI} shown a example view.

The Morfeas WEB NOx-if Portal split in two sections. The Upper section contains the graph and some controls related to it.
At the lower section, provided live information related to the CAN-if power supply section and the UNiNOx on interest.

To start a measurement the heater of the UNiNOx sensor must be energized. This done from the button at the right bottom corner.
To energize/de-energize both UNiNOx (in case that are two in chain) you can press and hold the \textbf{"Shift"} key.
In addition to this an autoPowerOFF mechanism is provided, the value of the \textbf{"PowerOFF(sec)"} field is set the autoPowerOFF time in seconds.

The graph show the valid reading from the sensor. A zoom in mechanism is provided with purpose to provide further examination of the graph.
This mechanism works by click and select a portion of the graph (ex. figure \ref{fig:NOX-if_UI_zoom}).
